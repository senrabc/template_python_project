TODO: [A](senrabc@gmail.com)20170501 Get raw data from drop box
TODO: [A](senrabc@gmail.com)20170501 Add data to sqlite db

TODO: [A](senrabc@gmail.com)20170501 @story The idea will be to run the raw
  nacc data through the ALGDX algo. and then output something like:

  subjectid, algdx, nacc_dx
  -------------------------
  100-101, Pre-MCI, MCI
  100-102, MCI, Dementia

  This is the information that will satisfy (from Grant):
  Aim 1: To subclassify older adults into well-defined cognitive status
  entities, using a diagnostic algorithm which takes into account a combination
  of amnestic and non-amnestic neuropsychological tests scores and the assigned
  clinical dementia rating.

  Aim 1 hypothesis: Older adults will be classified into well-defined cognitive
  status categories after review and categorization using a combination of
  neuropsychological tests scores and CDR rating.


TODO: [A](senrabc@gmail.com)20170509 @task Convert the truth table into a CSV
  that can be parsed and conveted into an ASCII table. Do this in VIM

TODO: [A](senrabc@gmail.com)20170510 @task Document that the max for a CDR sum
  of boxes score can go as high as 18. This needs to be reflected in Truth Table
